After the 2022 Collective Bargaining agreement between the MLB and the MLB Player's Union, they agreed to an overhaul of the MLB Draft.

The 18 non-playoff teams enter in a lottery for the top 6 picks. Each team's chance of getting the number one pick is weighted starting at 16.5% for the worst three records. The eighteenth team has a 0.23% chance of getting the number one pick.
